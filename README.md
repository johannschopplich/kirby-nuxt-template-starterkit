# Kirby Nuxt Starterkit

This repository is a port of the [Kirby Starter Kit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit) to Nuxt 3. The content is fetched with the [`nuxt-kql`](https://nuxt-kql.jhnn.dev) module from a [headless Kirby](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-headless-starter) instance.

This is my best practice solution to build a Nuxt 3 based frontend on top of Kirby in headless mode.

## Key Features

- 🫂 Kirby Query Language with [`nuxt-kql`](https://nuxt-kql.jhnn.dev)
- 🪁 [Component based Kirby Blocks](./components/Kirby/Block/)
- 🏛 Global [site data](./plugins/site.ts) similiar to Kirby's `$site`
- 🗳 [Collections](./composables/collections.ts) for pre-defined queries
- 🔎 SSR generated SEO meta data
- 📐 Prettier & ESLint
- 🔢 Pre-configured [VSCode settings](./.vscode/settings.json)
- 🔖 And much more!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, please make sure you have installed the recommended setup.

- **Node.js**<sup>\*</sup> (v16, the latest LTS version) 👉 [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
- **pnpm**<sup>\*</sup> (the fast and disk space efficient package manager) 👉 [[Download](https://pnpm.io/installation)]
- **Visual Studio Code** 👉 [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
- **Volar Extension** 👉 [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)]
  - Enable [**Take Over Mode**](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#takeover-mode)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Adapt the relevant environment variables:

```bash
# Base URL of the Kirby backend
KIRBY_BASE_URL=
# Token for bearer authentication
# See https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-headless-starter#bearer-token
KIRBY_API_TOKEN=
```

## Development

Start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment).

## FAQ

### Are There Any Drawbacks?

Data is fetched within Suspense components to ensure pre-rendered state for the user and SEO. Thus, the initial server response time is increased by about 50–100 ms for the initial KQL page query. This might be a road blocker for you. It's fine for my usecase. Still a lot faster than WordPress etc. 😉
